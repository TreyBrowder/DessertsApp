Small project created with SwiftUI to display a list of desserts and dessert details (i.e ingredients, and recipe instructions) from an API. 

Note: There are 2 branchs, main and a feature branch.  
MAIN branch - immplements a list view with all desserts - main project to be judged

FEATURE branch - implements a lazy vgrid - I didn't really like this immplementation. 
                 I tried it with a single column and 2 columns, I only kept it to show 
                 I know how to use the older version of the Navigation stack and how to 
                 work with grid views.

Features:
  - Swift Concurrency (Async/Await)
  - custom Async Image loading with cache support
  - API Response caching
  - unit tests with both business logic and UI logic examples using XCTest - overall coverage: 89.4%
  - Data transformations using high order functions
  - search bar with filtering functionality based on entered text
  - Newer version of the Navigation Stack
